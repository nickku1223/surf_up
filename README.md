# Summary
The average temperature for June and December falls within the low to mid-70s, which is a great temperature range for the surf and ice cream shop, with the high temperatures in the mid-80s showing that the business can be sustainable year-round.

On top of the temperature, the precipitation for both months is low (as shown below) which is perfect for outdoor activities! From the weather data we gather for June and December, we can see that not just the summer will be great for water activities, but also the winter! In conclusion, the weather condition in Oahu will be great for a surf and ice cream shop!
